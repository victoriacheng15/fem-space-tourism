# Space tourism website solution

The challenge is to build out this [Space tourism website challenge](https://www.frontendmentor.io/challenges/space-tourism-multipage-website-gRWj1URZ3) and get it looking as close to the design as possible.

The goals:

- Learn more about `React`
- View the optimal layout for each of the website's pages depending on their device's screen size
- See hover states for all interactive elements on the page
- View each page and be able to toggle between the tabs to see new information
